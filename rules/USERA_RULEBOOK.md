# UserA Trading Rulebook - SBS Methodology

**Compact Version - Quick Reference Guide**  
**Based on analysis of 7 trading charts (Jan-Feb 2026)**

---

## Core Philosophy

UserA's methodology is built on the **SBS (Sweep-Break-Structure)** pattern:

> **"Price sweeps liquidity (stops) before making the real move. Identify the sweep, confirm the structure break, enter on the retracement."**

### Key Principles:
- Trade WITH institutions (after they collect liquidity)
- Multiple confirmations required (structure + sweep + trigger + Fibonacci)
- Multi-timeframe alignment essential
- Patience over speed (wait for P5, not P4)

---

## The SBS Pattern: P1-P5 Sequence

### Point 1 (P1): Reference Point
- **Bullish:** Initial low or reference low
- **Bearish:** Initial high or reference high
- **Purpose:** Establishes starting point for measurement

### Point 2 (P2): Counter-Move
- **Bullish:** First high after P1
- **Bearish:** First low after P1
- **Purpose:** Creates range for Fibonacci (P1 to P2 = Fib anchor)

### Point 3 (P3): The Sweep (MSB)
- **Bullish:** New low, sweeps below structure (liquidity grab)
- **Bearish:** New high, sweeps above structure
- **Marked:** Orange/tan zones, "SWEEP" annotation
- **Purpose:** The fake-out that triggers the real move

### Point 4 (P4): Setup Zone
- **Bullish:** Pullback after initial bounce from P3
- **Bearish:** Rally after initial drop from P3
- **WARNING:** Do NOT enter at P4 (too early!)
- **Purpose:** Patience zone, wait for P5

### Point 5 (P5): Entry Point
- **Location:** Inside cyan/green boxes
- **Confluence:** Fibonacci golden zone (0.618-0.786)
- **Marked:** Pink "entry" label for precision
- **Purpose:** Actual entry execution zone

## Swing Identification Method

UserA uses **MULTIPLE METHODS** (not fixed candle count):

### Method 1: Structure-Based (Primary)
- **BOS (Break of Structure):** Explicit structural breaks
- **CHoCH (Change of Character):** Trend reversals
- **NOT based on "3-candle" or "5-candle" rules**
- **Structure significance determines swings**

### Method 2: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation
- Lower TF break FIRST → Higher TF confirmation
- Example: "BOS 1-MIN" → then "BOS" on higher TF
- Entry on lower TF (1min, 5min), setup on higher TF (30min, 1H)

### Method 3: Level-Based
- Previous Day High/Low (PDH/PDL)
- Previous Week High/Low (PWH/PWL)
- Session levels (open/close)
- Red horizontal lines = Major levels
- Orange horizontal lines = Secondary levels

### Valid Swing Criteria:
✅ Significant structure point (not random candle)  
✅ Multi-timeframe relevance  
✅ Aligns with key session levels  
✅ BOS or CHoCH confirmation  

---

## MSB (Market Structure Break) Recognition

### 3-Step MSB Process:

**Step 1: Identify Structure**
- Bearish: Previous swing HIGH
- Bullish: Previous swing LOW
- Marked with horizontal lines

**Step 2: The Sweep**
- Price breaks BEYOND structure (liquidity grab)
- Orange/tan zones mark sweep areas
- Annotated as "SWEEP", "SWEEP→ SBS"
- Retail stops are hit (liquidity collection)

**Step 3: Reversal & Confirmation**
- Immediate reversal after sweep
- BOS in opposite direction
- "trigger" annotation shows confirmation
- CHoCH may appear (character change)

### MSB Confirmed When:
✅ Price sweeps beyond previous structure  
✅ Fails to hold the new level  
✅ Reverses sharply in opposite direction  
✅ BOS occurs in new direction  
✅ "trigger" or "TRIGGER 100%" signal appears  

---

## Fibonacci Application

### Fibonacci Anchor: P1 to P2
- **Bullish:** P1 (low) to P2 (high)
- **Bearish:** P1 (high) to P2 (low)

### Retracement Levels (Entry):
- **0.618 (61.80%)** - Golden Zone (primary entry)
- **0.786 (78.60%)** - Deep golden zone
- **0.50 (50.00%)** - Mid-level (often marked in yellow/green)
- **Entry Zone = 0.618 to 0.786**

### Extension Levels (Targets):
- **1.618 (161.80%)** - TP1 (take 25-33%)
- **2.00 (200.00%)** - TP2 (take 25-33%)
- **2.618 (261.80%)** - TP3 (take 20-25%)
- **4.236 (423.60%)** - TP4 (take most remaining)
- **6.86 (686.00%)** - TP5 (runner, trail stop)

---

## Entry Strategy

### Multi-Phase Entry Process:

**Phase 1: Setup Recognition**
1. Identify structure (previous swings)
2. Wait for sweep (MSB, P3 formation)
3. Confirm reversal (BOS in new direction)

**Phase 2: Trigger Confirmation** ⚠️ CRITICAL!
- **"trigger" or "TRIGGER 100%" annotation**
- Do NOT enter without trigger!
- Trigger signals:
  - BOS on entry timeframe
  - CHoCH confirmation
  - Reversal candle pattern at golden zone
  - Multi-timeframe alignment

**Phase 3: Entry Execution**
- Inside cyan/green boxes
- Pink "entry" label = exact point
- At Fibonacci golden zone (0.618-0.786)
- Confluence with structure

### Entry Zone Characteristics:
- **Large zones (15min+):** Patient, multiple entries possible
- **Small zones (1min, 5min):** Precision, single entry
- **Cyan/Green = GO** (when trigger confirmed)
- **Orange/Tan = WAIT** (setup/sweep area)
- **Pink/Red = STOP** (rejection/invalidation)

### Entry Rules:
✅ **Enter when:**
- Setup complete (P1-P5 identified)
- Sweep confirmed (P3 swept liquidity)
- **Trigger signal received** (NOT just setup!)
- Price in golden zone (P5, 0.618-0.786)
- Multi-timeframe aligned
- Inside cyan/green box

❌ **Do NOT enter:**
- Without trigger confirmation
- At P4 (too early!)
- In orange sweep zones (during sweep)
- In pink/red rejection zones
- Without multi-timeframe confirmation

---

## Risk Management

### Stop-Loss Placement:
**Bullish:** Below P5, below cyan box, beyond sweep zone  
**Bearish:** Above P5, above cyan box, beyond sweep zone  

**Stop Distance (Timeframe-Dependent):**
- 1min: ~15-20 points
- 5min: ~20-50 points
- 15min+: ~50-150 points

### Take-Profit (Scaling Strategy):
- **TP1 (161.80%):** Take 25-33%
- **TP2 (200.00%):** Take 25-33%
- **TP3 (261.80%):** Take 20-25%
- **TP4 (423.60%):** Take most remaining (50-75%)
- **TP5 (686.00%):** Runner with trailing stop

### Risk:Reward:
- Minimum **1.5:1**, often **2:1 to 3:1+**
- Let winners run to 423.60% or 686%

---

## Multi-Timeframe Approach

### MTF Workflow:

**Step 1: Higher Timeframe (30min, 1H, 4H)**
- Identify major structure (swings, BOS, CHoCH)
- Find potential SBS setups
- Mark key levels (PDH/PDL, PWH/PWL)

**Step 2: Lower Timeframe (1min, 5min, 15min)**
- "BOS 1-MIN" appears first
- Wait for higher TF confirmation ("BOS")

**Step 3: Entry Execution (1min, 5min)**
- Precise entry timing on lower TF
- Inside golden zone from higher TF

**Step 4: Trade Management**
- Monitor both timeframes
- Scale out at Fib extensions
- Trail stop based on entry TF structure

### MTF Confirmation:
✅ Setup on higher TF (structure identification)  
✅ BOS on lower TF first (early signal)  
✅ BOS on higher TF (validation)  
✅ Entry on lower TF (precision)  
✅ All timeframes aligned (highest probability)

## Pattern Variations

### Standard SBS
- "SWEEP→ SBS"
- Simple sweep + reversal + entry
- Clear P1-P5 sequence
- Use for clean, simple structure

### UMO SBS (Advanced)
- "UMO SBS", "UMO 1 MIN - SWEEP SBS"
- More complex setup
- Involves gaps/unfilled orders/order blocks
- Multiple sweeps or nested patterns
- Use for complex market structure

### Multi-Wave SBS
- Multiple P3, P4, P5 marks
- Nested patterns (SBS within SBS)
- Evolving analysis
- Use for choppy price action, scaling entries

---

## Smart Money Concepts (SMC)

### BOS (Break of Structure)
- Price breaks significant swing high (bearish) or low (bullish)
- Indicates structural shift
- Look for multi-TF BOS for strength

### CHoCH (Change of Character)
- Early trend reversal signal
- Often appears with sweep
- Precedes or confirms BOS

### Liquidity Sweeps
- Price moves beyond level to trigger stops
- Core of SBS pattern (P3)
- Orange/tan zones mark sweep areas
- Entry AFTER sweep, not during

### Order Blocks (Implied)
- Cyan entry boxes often align with order blocks
- Confluence with Fibonacci = strong OB
- Wait for price to return to OB

---

## Visual Annotation System

### Color Code:
- **Orange/Tan:** Sweep areas, setup zones (WAIT)
- **Cyan/Green:** Entry zones (GO when triggered)
- **Pink/Red:** Stop zones, precise entry markers
- **Red Lines:** Major levels (PDH/PDL/PWH/PWL)
- **Orange Lines:** Secondary structure

### Text Annotations:
- **1-5:** P1-P5 sequence
- **"SWEEP":** Liquidity grab area
- **"BOS":** Break of Structure
- **"BOS 1-MIN":** Lower TF BOS
- **"CHoCH":** Change of Character
- **"trigger"/"TRIGGER 100%":** Confirmation point
- **"entry":** Exact entry point
- **"UMO":** Pattern type
- **"→ SBS":** Process flow
- **Fib Labels:** Target levels (686%, 423.60%, etc.)

## Key Rules Summary

### The 3 Golden Rules:
1. **Never enter without trigger** (setup ≠ trigger)
2. **Always wait for P5** (P4 is too early)
3. **Multi-timeframe alignment required** (not just one TF)

### The UserA Mantra:
> **"Let them sweep the stops. Wait for the reversal. Confirm the structure break. Enter in the golden zone with trigger. Scale out, let runners run."**

**P1-P2:** Fibonacci anchor  
**P3:** Sweep (WAIT, don't enter)  
**P4:** Setup (WAIT, still too early)  
**P5:** Entry (GO when trigger confirmed)  

**Fibonacci Entry:** 0.618-0.786 (golden zone)  
**Fibonacci Targets:** 161%, 200%, 261%, 423%, 686%  

**Colors:** Orange = Wait | Cyan = Go | Pink/Red = Stop  

**Minimum R:R:** 1.5:1 (prefer 2:1 to 3:1+)  

**MTF:** Higher TF setup → Lower TF entry  

**Trigger Required:** BOS + CHoCH + Reversal candle + MTF aligned
