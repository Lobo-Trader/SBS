# SBS Pattern Analysis Framework

## Analysis Structure

For each trading chart, we analyze the following phases:

### PHASE 0: CONTEXT (Before the Sequence)

#### Previous Swing Identification
- **Candle Method**: How many candles left and right? (e.g., "3 left + 3 right")
- **Structure Method**: Higher High/Lower Low identification
- **Level Method**: PDH/PDL/PWH/PWL breaks
- **Volume Confirmation**: Increased volume at swing points

#### MSB (Market Structure Break)
- Which level is broken?
- When/where does the break occur?
- How clear is the break?
- Volume at the break?
- Confirmation signals?

### PHASE 1: SBS SEQUENCE

#### P1: First Point (After MSB)
- Why exactly here?
- Which swing criteria are met?
- Swing-High/-Low confirmed?
- Start of the SBS sequence

#### P2-P5: Continuation Points
- P2: Second point
- P3: Third point  
- P4: Fourth point
- P5: Fifth point (Entry Zone)

### PHASE 2: FIBONACCI & ENTRY

#### Fibonacci Retracement
- From P1-P2 or P1-P3?
- Key levels: 0.618, 0.786, 1.0, 1.272, 1.618, etc.

#### Entry Strategy
- Entry levels (Golden Zone: 0.618-0.786)
- Stop-Loss placement (below/above P5 or structure)
- Take-Profit zones (Fibonacci extensions)

#### Risk Management
- Risk:Reward ratio
- Position sizing
- Scaling in/out strategy

## Swing Criteria Methods

### Method 1: Candle Count
```
Example: "3-Candle-Swing"
├─ Minimum 3 candles left of swing
├─ Minimum 3 candles right of swing
├─ = Swing is confirmed
└─ Then search for MSB!

Variations: "5-Candle-Swing", "7-Candle-Swing", etc.
```

### Method 2: Structure Break
```
├─ Higher High broken (Bearish)
├─ Lower Low broken (Bullish)
├─ CHoCH (Change of Character)
└─ BOS (Break of Structure)
```

### Method 3: Level Break
```
├─ PDH (Previous Day High)
├─ PDL (Previous Day Low)
├─ PWH (Previous Week High)
├─ PWL (Previous Week Low)
└─ Session Highs/Lows
```

### Method 4: Volume Confirmation
```
├─ Increased volume at swing
├─ Climax/Exhaustion
└─ Reversal signal
```
